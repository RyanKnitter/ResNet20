# ResNet20

In the [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) paper, the authors describe networks that were tested on the CIFAR10 dataset. Models were built with 20, 32, 44, and 56 layers. In this repository, the 20-layer model was recreated in [pytorch](pytorch.org). The purpose of this repository is to explicitly show each layer in the network so those who are new to this type of model can get a better understanding of how they work.
